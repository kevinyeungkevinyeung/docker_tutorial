image

    Templates/ blueprints for containers

    contains code + required tools/ runtimes

    can create multiple containers with the same image

containers

    The running "unit of software"

Finding/ creating images

    docker hub

    create your own, custom image   

        write your own dockfile

How images work?

    change in the source will not be in the container, 
    we will need to rebuild the images to include any changes in the source code

    docker cache all the instruction result, docker can infer that it doesn't need to go thru the same instruction again
    it will use the cache result, if it doesn't required to do the instruction again -- layer based architecture

    if one layer is changed, then all the following layers will be re-executed

Detach mode vs Attach mode

    By default,
        docker run is in attach mode

        docker start is in detach mode

Image Tags
    name    
        Defines a group of possible more specialized, images
        i.e. "node"

    Tags
        Defines a specialized image within a group of images
        i.e. "14"

Sharing Imgaes & containers
    Everyone who has an imgae can create container based on the image

    share a dockerfile
        simply run docker build

        important: The Dockerfile instruction might need surrounding files/ folders (e.g. source code)

    Share a built image
        download an image, run a container based on it

        no build step required, everything is included in the image already

    Sharing via Docker hub or private registry
        Docker hub or Private registry

    Share
        docker push IMAGE_NAME

    Use 
        docker pull IMAGE_NAME
