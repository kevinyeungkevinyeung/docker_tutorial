Containers & Netowrks

    connecting containers

    out of the box, containers can connect to WWW, this doesn't require any aditional setup

Connection to local service
    replace localhost with host.docker.internal

    for example:

        mongodb://localhost:27017/swfavirities => mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/swfavirities

Creating Container Netowrks

    allow communication between multiple containers

    Can put multiple container into one network

    docker run --network <my_network>

    create a network
        docker network create favorites-net

        this will work if the containers is in the same network
        mongodb://<container name>:27017/swfavirities
