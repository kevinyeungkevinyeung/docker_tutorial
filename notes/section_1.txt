What is docker? and Why?

    Docker is a container technology: A tool for creating and managing containers

    container -> a standardized unit of software, a package of code nad dependencies to run that code

Why would we want independent, standardized "application packages"?

    Different development production Environments

    We want to build and test in exactly! the same Environments as we later run our app in

    Every team member should have the exactly same env. when working on the same project.

    When switching between projects, tools used in project A should not clash with tools used in project B.
